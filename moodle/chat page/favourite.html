                    Is 1 day enough for Mysore? If you have just one day to spend in Mysore, you can cover some of the major attractions like the Mysore Palace, Brindavan Gardens, or the Mysore Zoo. However, in order to enjoy all that this wonderful city has to offer you must spend at least 2 or 3 days here.
