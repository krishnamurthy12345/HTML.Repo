            wicket-keeper batsmen for Karnataka at the domestic level and is the captain for Lucknow Super Giants in the
            Indian Premier League.
            He generally plays as an opener in Test and T20 formats of the game and plays in the middle order in the
            ODIs. Rahul is an occasional wicketkeeper in the shorter formats of the game at the international level,
            whereas he keeps the wicket more often at the domestic level. He's also one of the more prominent members in
            leading the discussion around the theory of strike rates being overrated in T20.
            He made his international debut in 2014 against Australia in the Boxing Day Test-match in Melbourne. Two
            years after his Test debut, Rahul made his One-Day International Debut in 2016 against Zimbabwe.
